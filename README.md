# jurgas++
C++ recreation/rebuild of the infamous UT student program.

Does not include the webscraper part, just the optimizations of the search feature and data storage mainly.

Compiling the program required wxWidgets. I had it in my C:\ directory so that is also the one listed in the visual studio project and sln file.

The sqlite used i the program is included with the files.


Compiled with:

- wxWidgets 3.2.4

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10.0

- C++14


On both:

- Intel core i5-8265U

- Ryzen 9 5900x
